OpenSSL has a bug in its handling of TLS 1.3 session tickets that can
cause deadlocks or data loss in some rare edge cases. These edge cases
most frequently happen during tests. (OpenSSL bugs: `#7948
<https://github.com/openssl/openssl/issues/7948>`__, `#7967
<https://github.com/openssl/openssl/issues/7967>`__.) `trio.SSLStream`
now works around this issue, so you don't have to worry about it.
